"""CPU backend (for golden baseline or no-device testing).

Renamed from CpuBackend. CPU has no ``torch.cpu.get_device_name`` (torch exposes
no ``torch.cpu`` module), so device_name is permanently overridden to alias()
('cpu') — this is the contract, not a placeholder. CPU backends never go
through the profiler ``_build`` path (which would inject torch_lib/profile), so
both are provided as class attributes here for state self-consistency.
