"""XPU (hardware accelerator) backend.

The torch-level device API (is_available /
device_count / to_device / synchronize) all come from TorchBackend via
``getattr(torch, torch_lib)``. This class is the generic accelerator backend used
for any torch_lib that is not 'npu' or 'cpu' (mlu/musa/...); the segment
identity (alias) is config-driven via _segment_name injected by _build.
