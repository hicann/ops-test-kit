"""X-API response header (Task 3): server writes the resolved api back on both
the success branch (_send_run_ok) and the error branch (_send_json).

This prevents the client from guessing whether the server actually resolved the
api it was asked to run — it just reads the X-API header. Covers:
  - success: env has api -> X-API header written
  - backward-compat: env api=None -> no X-API header (old envelopes still work)
  - error: _send_json writes X-API from env (spec §4.2 C4)
